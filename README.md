# About HiChat: A Real-time MERN Chatting Application

HiChat is a cutting-edge fullstack web project that showcases my expertise in developing interactive and secure web applications. Built on the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) stack, HiChat is a feature-rich real-time chatting application that takes user interaction to the next level.

## Key Features

### Real-time Communication
HiChat revolutionizes online communication by offering seamless real-time messaging. Users can connect with their friends and engage in live conversations without any delays or page refreshes. The application utilizes WebSockets to instantly update messages on both ends, creating a dynamic and engaging chatting experience.

### Secure Authentication
Security is at the forefront of HiChat. The application employs industry-standard encryption techniques such as bcrypt to securely store and manage user passwords. JWT (JSON Web Tokens) are utilized for user authorization at every step, ensuring a safe and trusted environment for users to interact.

### Friend System
HiChat enhances social interaction by allowing users to connect with friends. Users can send friend requests, expanding their network and enabling private conversations. The friend system is designed for ease of use and a seamless user experience.

### Modern User Interface
HiChat boasts a modern and intuitive user interface built with React. The clean and user-friendly design enhances usability and encourages engagement, making it easy for users to navigate, chat, and manage their connections.
